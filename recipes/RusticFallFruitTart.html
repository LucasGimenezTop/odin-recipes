                <p>This rustic fall fruit tart is the perfect combination of apples, cranberries, walnuts, and some sensational spices. Not only is this dish baked in a cream cheese pastry, but each bite is bursting with fruity flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour.</li>
                <li>½ cup butter, chilled.</li>
                <li>½ cup cream cheese.</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed.</li>
                <li>4 apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced.</li>
                <li>⅔ cup fresh cranberries.</li>
                <li>¼ cup brown sugar, or more to taste.</li>
                <li>¼ cup white sugar, or more to taste.</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon.</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg.</li>
                <li>⅓ cup roughly chopped walnuts, or more to taste.</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten.</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon raw sugar.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place 2 cups flour in a bowl. Cut butter and cream cheese into flour using a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gently mix water into flour mixture until dough forms into a ball.</li>
                <li>Mix apples and cranberries with brown sugar, white sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until coated.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Roll dough onto a lightly floured work surface, forming about an 11-inch circle. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Arrange apple-cranberry mixture decoratively on the dough, leaving a 2-inch rim of exposed dough. Sprinkle walnuts over apple-cranberry mixture. Fold exposed crust up and over the edge of the fruit.</li>
                <li>Brush egg over the crust and around the edge of the tart; sprinkle with raw sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is tender, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
