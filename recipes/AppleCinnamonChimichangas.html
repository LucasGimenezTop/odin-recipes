                <p>Best Mexican-inspired breakfast or dessert!.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling.</li>
                <li>Â½ cup cinnamon sugar.</li>
                <li>15 (6 inch) flour tortillas.</li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat apple pie filling in a small pot over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place cinnamon sugar in a shallow dish.</li>
             <li>Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling onto each tortilla. Fold in opposing edges and roll up as you would a burrito.</li>
             <li>Heat oil in a large, deep saucepan over medium heat.</li>
             <li>Place a batch of rolled tortillas seam-side down in the hot oil and fry until browned and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue frying until all sides are browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Roll in cinnamon sugar to coat. Repeat with remaining batches.</li>
